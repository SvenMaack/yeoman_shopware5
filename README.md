# Yeoman Generator for Shopware 5

This projects tries to **reduce the boilerplate** of [Shopware 5](https://www.shopware.com/de/migration/infos-zu-shopware-5/) plugin implementations. 

Most shopware 5 engineers will copy&pasta the same boilerplate all over again to create a new service, register it in xml, create a model or adding some subsriber...

This generator tries to speed up these steps by providing some easy to use generators that create the most common use cases automatically. It uses the common [yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) prompting style.
